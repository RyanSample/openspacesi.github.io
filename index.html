                            <p>Our members are talented, and we are all open to sharing our knowledge. OpenSpace organizes "crash courses" on technology relevant to the projects being worked on here. Our crash courses will bring you up to speed and get you ready to hack away. The best part? They are open to the public. Thats right, you don't have to be a member to attend our crash courses! These courses give you the opportunity to hop into ongoing projects, or the ability to start your own. We want you to create cool things, and our courses empower you to do just that. A quick rundown of some exciting crash courses we have:</p>

                            <p>OpenSpace has aquired a large quantity of quality hardware for our members to hack on. Maybe you came here with a big dream, maybe you took one of our crash courses and want to learn more, or maybe you just like to tinker. Whatever your motivations may be, we have tools to help you succeed. From commodity hardware to cutting edge tech, OpenSpace has one of the best collections of technology in the area, and we offer it to you in a collaborative and engaging environment.

                            <p>We offer "running projects" (project tab on the nav bar above) that give our members an opportunity to help out in the community. We partner with local businesses and organizations to improve their operations through our facilities. We offer free memebership to OpenSpace for members who help with these projects. There are opportunities for all levels of knowledge and experience to help, from helping businesses relocate to designing websites and POS systems. A few of our current partners:</p>
